# Password Manager Project Summary

In this project, I developed a simple password manager using Python and SQLite. The main features include:

- **Database Management**: I created a SQLite database to securely store user accounts and their associated passwords. I implemented functions to create, populate, delete, and display tables.

- **Password Hashing**: I used SHA-256 hashing to securely store passwords, ensuring that sensitive data is not stored in plain text.

- **User Authentication**: I implemented a login function that verifies usernames and hashed passwords, providing error handling for incorrect credentials.

- **Dynamic Search**: I built a flexible search feature that allows filtering user accounts based on various parameters, enabling easy retrieval of stored information.
